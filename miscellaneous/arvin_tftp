[success] this method is dowload only

The servers that can be managed by the xinetd daemon are each listed in a server-specific configuration file located in the directory /etc/xinetd.d. The file for the TFTP server is named tftp, and looks like the following:

# default: off
# description: The tftp server serves files using the Trivial File Transfer \
#    Protocol.  The tftp protocol is often used to boot diskless \
#    workstations, download configuration files to network-aware printers, \
#    and to start the installation process for some operating systems.
service tftp
{
    socket_type     = dgram
    protocol        = udp
    wait            = yes
    user            = froot
    server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
    server_args     = -s /home/froot/tftpboot
    disable         = yes
}
/etc/inetd.conf

Restarting the Service
# /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
# /etc/init.d/inetd restart

ps -alxww | grep inet

[fail]this way will be fail the user can not be nobody. 
beside this, other information is good to referance.

TFTP Server Install and Setup

1. Install following packages.

sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp

2. Create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp and put this entry

service tftp
{
protocol        = udp
port            = 69
socket_type     = dgram
wait            = yes
user            = nobody
server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args     = /tftpboot
disable         = no
}

3. Create a folder /tftpboot this should match whatever you gave in server_args. mostly it will be tftpboot

sudo mkdir /tftpboot
sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot
4. Restart the xinetd service.

newer systems:
sudo service xinetd restart
older systems:
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart

Now our tftp server is up and running.

[success]
step 1:
sudo aptitude install tftp-server
it will choose the tftpd-hpa.

step 2: 
modified file "sudo vim /etc/default/tftpd-hpa"
TFTP_USERNAME="froot"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/home/froot/tftpboot"
TFTP_ADDRESS=":69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="-l -c -s"

step 3:
mkdir ~/tftpboot
chmod -R 777 tftpboot

step 4:
sudo service tftpd-hpa restart
sudo service tftpd-hpa status
